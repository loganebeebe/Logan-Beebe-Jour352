                    <p>
                        After listening to hundreds of hours of ape calls, a team of scientists say they have detected a
                        hallmark of human language: the ability to put together strings of sounds to create new
                        meanings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The provocative finding, published Thursday in the journal Science, drew praise from some
                        scholars and skepticism from others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Federica Amici, a primatologist at the University of Leipzig in Germany, said that the study
                        helped place the roots of language even further back in time, to millions of years before the
                        emergence of our species.

                    <p>
                        But other researchers said that the study, which had been conducted on bonobos, close relatives
                        of chimpanzees, had little to reveal about how we use words. “The present findings don’t tell us
                        anything about the evolution of language,” said Johan Bolhuis, a neurobiologist at Utrecht
                        University in the Netherlands.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many species can communicate with sounds. But when an animal makes a sound, it typically means
                        just one thing. Monkeys, for instance, can make one warning call in reference to a leopard and a
                        different one for an incoming eagle flying.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In contrast, we humans can string words together in ways that combine their individual meanings
                        into something new. Suppose I say, “I am a bad dancer.” When I combine the words “bad” and
                        “dancer,” I no longer mean them independently; I’m not saying, “I am a bad person who also
                        happens to dance.” Instead, I mean that I don’t dance well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Linguists call this compositionality, and have long considered it an essential ingredient of
                        language. “It’s the force behind language’s creativity and productivity,” said Simon Townsend, a
                        comparative psychologist at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. “Theoretically, you can
                        come up with any phrase that has never been uttered before.” For decades, scientists found no
                        clear sign of compositionality in other species. But a few years ago Dr. Townsend and his
                        colleagues discovered a hint of it in chimpanzees.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In a Ugandan forest, Dr. Townsend’s team recorded more than 330 hours of chimpanzees going about
                        their daily lives, and identified a dozen distinct calls. To the untrained ear, the recordings
                        might sound like a random cacophony. But Dr. Townsend and his colleagues noticed that certain
                        calls followed others more than would be expected by chance alone. All told, they identified 15
                        distinctive pairs of calls.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The scientists wondered if a pair of calls carried a meaning greater than that of two individual
                        calls on their own. To test that hypothesis, they spent two years studying one pair in
                        particular: a call known as “waa-bark,” followed by another known as “alarm-huu.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Chimpanzees make the waa-bark call as a way to bring other chimpanzees to them. An ape will make
                        the call during a hunt, for instance, or to summon allies during a fight. They make the
                        alarm-huu call when frightened or surprised — in response to an earthquake, perhaps, or the
                        unexpected sight of a scientist’s raincoat.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dr. Townsend and his colleagues wondered if “alarm-huu” when it was followed by “waa-bark” meant
                        something else. They noticed two occasions in which a chimpanzee paired the calls when it
                        encountered a snake while other chimpanzees were within earshot. Perhaps, the scientists
                        thought, the two calls together meant something like, “Get over here and help me deal with this
                        snake!” Experiments followed. In one, the researchers pulled a fake snake across a trail as
                        chimpanzees passed by. The apes, as predicted, often responded with “alarm-huu” followed by
                        “waa-bark.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The researchers then played the pair of calls through loudspeakers and watched how chimpanzees
                        reacted. The apes tended to look at the loudspeaker for a long time; almost a minute. If it
                        played only “alarm-huu” or “waa-bark” on their own, the chimpanzees glanced over for just a few
                        seconds.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An additional clue suggested that the two calls combined to form a snake alarm: When some
                        chimpanzees heard the paired calls, they leaped into a tree, a typical response (among apes)
                        when snakes are around.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As intriguing as these ideas were, testing them was slow going. To broaden the research, and
                        speed it along, Dr. Townsend began collaborating with Martin Surbeck, a behavioral ecologist at
                        Harvard who studies bonobos, a species of ape that split off from chimpanzees two million years
                        ago. Dr. Surbeck and his colleagues have spent years following apes in the Kokolopori Bonobo
                        Reserve in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2022, Melissa Berthet, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Townsend’s lab, joined with them to
                        eavesdrop on the apes. She made 400 hours of recordings, capturing 567 single calls and 425
                        pairs. Dr. Berthet also made a note of what had happened just before the bonobos made their
                        calls. Did a tree fall? Was the ape making a nest for the night, or grooming a friend? Dr.
                        Berthet filled out a 336-item checklist for every call.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Shane Steinert-Threlkeld, a computational linguist at the University of Washington who was not
                        involved in the study, said that the scale of the collected data was unmatched in this line of
                        research. “For that reason, I’m very excited about it,” he said.
                    </p>

                    <p>This slideshow shows various species known for complex vocalizations.</p>

                    <p>
                        Back in Zurich, Dr. Berthet listened to the recordings and classified the calls into a dozen
                        different types. To analyze the meaning of the calls, she analyzed her checklist. She and her
                        colleagues then used some of the mathematical techniques that artificial intelligence systems
                        like ChatGPT use to learn how words are related to each other. This analysis allowed the
                        scientists to map the bonobo calls visually; the closer the calls appeared to each other on the
                        map, the more similar their meanings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The researchers also found that the bonobos frequently employed 16 specific pairs of calls, and
                        that most pairs showed up on the map in the same neighborhood as the two individual sounds
                        comprising them. This suggested that their combination conveyed no special meaning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But four pairs of calls stood out. These landed on the map far from the placement of their two
                        individual calls; together, it seemed, they carried a meaning unlike either call alone. One such
                        pair, for instance, combined two calls: a high hoot, generally made when a bonobo is trying to
                        draw the attention of others far away, and a low hoot, made when the bonobo is excited by some
                        emotion.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Combined, the two calls seem to express something more, perhaps a rescue plea to distant bonobos
                        when under attack. “It would be like, ‘Pay attention to me because I am in distress,’” Dr.
                        Berthet said.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dr. Berthet said that the new results should address any skepticism about Dr. Townsend’s earlier
                        study on chimpanzees. “Linguists would always say, ‘Yeah, OK, but it’s just one combination —
                        what does it really tell us?’” she said. “Here we show actually bonobos have several
                        compositional structures, and they use them a lot.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Together, the two studies on bonobos and chimpanzees suggest that our common ancestor with these
                        apes also possessed compositionality, the researchers argue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Dr. Bolhuis questioned whether the new study could actually detect compositionality in
                        bonobos. “Compositionality is not just about combining two words,” he said: It’s also about
                        following rules of syntax to assemble words into phrases and bigger units of meaning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dr. Townsend countered that perhaps the act of pairing calls was a first step toward a
                        full-blown compositionality that had emerged later, in early humans.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A next step, Dr. Steinert-Threlkeld said, would be for researchers to analyze the bonobo data
                        with more sophisticated methods, to see if these results hold up. Maybe a computer could be
                        trained to learn the meanings of individual calls, then tested to see if it could predict the
                        meanings of pairs of calls it had never heard before. “It’s imperfect,” he said of the new
                        study. “But it’s a good first step.”
